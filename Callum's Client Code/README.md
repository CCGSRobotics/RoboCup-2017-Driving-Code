# Callum-s-Robotics-Code

(7 Feb 2018)
Oh my, the client code is getting over my head because there are so many obscure things in there.

1. LB and RB don't have event codes associated with them, so it would be great if someone could tell me.
2. As the values in defarm increase, do the limbs rotate clockwise or anticlockwise? Can they have negative values as well?
3. What really is the purpose of LT and RT? Isn't the left joystick meant to be the one moving the robot around?
4. How does event.value work? What are its min/max values?
5. What are switchONN, switchON() and switchOFF() meant to do?

Those are all my questions for now.
